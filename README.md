### Welcome!!

My name is Kufreabasi Ita and I am a .NET engineer. I have created solutions using C#, Javascript and Python programming languages. I am comfortable with utilizing established development tools and conventions such as the SOLID principles, test-driven development (TDD) and Domain Driven Design which are desired in today's highly sought-after software engineers. I also have a handle on using the MVC architectural pattern of web development to create scalable and extensible solutions.

I have a strong background in object-oriented development techniques and I'm proficient in manipulating tools including:

                        ASP.NET Core | HTML5 | CSS3 | SQL | Entity Framework Core | Identity | Git

I possess experience in enhancing existing systems by analyzing their existing capacity and identifying areas for modification and optimization. This gives me an in-depth understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle and Agile development methodologies.

- ðŸ”­ I currently specialize in building RESTful APIs.
- ðŸŒ± On my next stop in my continuous development trajectory, I'm learning to build world-class UIs for single-page applications using React.
- ðŸ“« Iâ€™m open to collaborating on projects which challenge me and expose me to new concepts and tools. Here's how to reach me:
